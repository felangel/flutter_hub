# FlutterHub

## About 
FlutterHub is a mobile application that allows developers to showcase their Flutter projects and hiring personnel to search for qualified, experienced Flutter developers. 

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, we utilized [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## To Run

Make sure that the Flutter SDK Path text field specifies the location of the SDK. Install the SDK if you havenâ€™t yet done so.
Enter a project name (for example, myapp), and press Next.

Run command: `flutter run`
